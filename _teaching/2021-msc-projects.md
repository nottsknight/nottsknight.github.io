I will be supervising some MSc projects this year. This page lists some suggestions
of projects I'd be interested in supervising---if you have project ideas of your
own that look like they might fit, feel free to get in touch!

## In-document visualisation of sentence clustering

- Suitable for: CS, CS(AI)

Text clustering is the process of grouping sections of text (e.g. sentences)
drawn from a larger body of text (e.g. a journal article) in order to bring similar
pieces of text together. This is often useful for helping people to understand
patterns in the text they are reading. In this project, you would be required
to develop some system capable of receiving a PDF document as input, performing
clustering on the sentences drawn from that document, and allowing the reader
to browse the generated clusters _in the context of the document_: that is,
they should be able to explore the document and see which sentences relate to which
as they read.

This will require a combination of software engineering skills for the
visualisation along with an understanding of how to carry out text clustering.
Depending on your expertise, the project can be weighted more heavily towards
either a sophisticated piece of software or an effective system for clustering.

## Design of tools to support the literature review workflow

- Suitable for: HCI

Literature review is a key component of any successful research project, and
there is always interest in developing tools capable of effectively supporting
this process. In this project, you would conduct a qualitative study of students
engaged in the literature review process, with the goal of identifying
particular opportunities for the introduction of new tools to aid in the process.
It will be up to you to identify how much of the process you wish to examine.

You will need to be prepared to interview your participants and get to understand
how they perform their work. Depending on the state of the pandemic come the summer,
this might also involve direct observation of participants carrying out parts
of their literature review.
