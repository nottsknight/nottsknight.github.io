I will be supervising two final year projects this year. My research covers
topics including text clustering and classification, human perceptions of
machine learning, and the reading and understanding of documents. In addition to
that, I'm a fan of Android development and building software in general, so I'm
also down for supervising anything that could involve just building something cool.

For starters, here are a few ideas, but if you've got an idea of your own
that you think I'd be interested in, let me know!

- **Enabling visual comparison of classification/clustering results**

  Text classification and clustering involve attempting to group similar pieces of
  text together. We can measure the success of these attempts numerically, but
  it's also interesting to learn how humans perceive the results of these methods.
  You'd build a tool (desktop, web, or Android) that would enable someone to
  compare the results of applying different classification/clustering methods to
  the same text.
